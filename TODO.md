# TODO

Review-surfaced fixes deferred for focused work. Distinct from
`WISHLIST.md` (feature wants) — everything here is a known defect or
cleanup with a diagnosis attached, deferred because the fix is
non-trivial or a judgment call.

## Low-priority / judgment calls

### 🤞 U1 (residual) — `file://` URLs still bypass script + workdir gates

`runtime/url.py`. The `max_remote_fetch_bytes` size cap now applies to
`file://` reads, but two gaps remain: `file://` still skips
`allow_remote_scripts`, and there is no path-within-workdir
confinement — `url: /etc/passwd` reads unconfined. Low severity under
the current trust model (a workflow author already controls what
executes), but a real robustness gap if workflow YAML ever comes from
a less-trusted source. Workdir confinement is the larger of the two
and deserves its own design pass.

The behavior is now **explicitly documented** as trusted-input (no
`file://` confinement) in `docs/schema-reference.md`, `TECHNICAL.md`,
and `SKILLS.md` — so it's no longer a silent gap; only the
confinement *fix* remains deferred here.
